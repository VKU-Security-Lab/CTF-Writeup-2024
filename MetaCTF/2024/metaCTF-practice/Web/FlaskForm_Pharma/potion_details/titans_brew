# Titan's Brew

**Titan's Brew** is a legendary elixir, renowned across countless lands for its ability to grant mortals a glimpse of the divine strength typically reserved for deities and mythical beings. This potent concoction is encapsulated in a robust flask, its contents agitating with a golden glow reminiscent of the molten core of a forge. The brew is the culmination of an arcane alchemical process, involving the distillation of ingredients both rare and powerful, including essences drawn from the earth's depths and extracts from the mightiest of creatures.

Upon imbibing Titan's Brew, an individual experiences an immediate surge in physical prowess, magnifying their strength to Herculean levels. This emboldens warriors to lift massive weights, break through barriers thought impregnable, and perform feats of strength that border on the realm of legend.

## Indications & Usage

Titan's Brew is indicated for:
- Circumstances necessitating extraordinary physical strength beyond the natural capabilities of the individual.
- Moments where feats of strength could prove pivotal, such as in combat scenarios, lifting or moving heavy objects, or breaking through sealed or magically fortified barriers.
- Physical competitions or challenges where peak strength is the key to victory.

**Administration:** To activate the potion's effects, the user must consume the entire contents of the flask. The enhancement in strength manifests rapidly, within minutes of consumption, lasting for a duration of up to one hour.

## Composition & Strength

Each flask of Titan's Brew contains:
- **Giant's Heart Essence:** Provides the foundation for the potion's strength-enhancing properties.
- **Ironwood Sap:** Grants increased resilience and endurance to the user's musculoskeletal structure.
- **Dragonbone Powder:** Amplifies the user's physical power to mythical proportions.
- **Elixir of Deepstone:** Fortifies the user's constitution, enabling the support of immense weights and forces.

## Warnings and Precautions

- **Risk of Injury:** Users must exercise caution, as their newfound strength may inadvertently cause harm to themselves or others.
- **Structural Damage:** Beware of potential property damage, as the enhanced strength may lead to unintended destruction of surroundings.
- **Physical Stress:** Following the potion's expiration, users may experience muscle fatigue or soreness due to the extraordinary exertions performed.

## Side Effects

## Storage and Handling

Titan's Brew should be stored in its original flask, kept in a cool, dark place away from direct sunlight and sources of heat. The flask should remain sealed until use to preserve the potion's potency.

## Disposal

Empty flasks and any remnants of Titan's Brew should be handled with care. They must be deactivated by an alchemical neutralizing agent before disposal to prevent accidental ingestion by wildlife or unintended exposure to the potion's effects.

Titan's Brew is not merely a potion but a testament to the alchemist's art, offering those who partake the ability to surpass the limits of mortal strength. With great power comes great responsibility, and thus, it behooves users to wield the might granted by this elixir with wisdom and restraint.
